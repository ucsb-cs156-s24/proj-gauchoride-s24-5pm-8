# S24-5pm-8 Release Notes

## Summary of Changes for Users:

1. **Improved Readability of Shift Table Headers**  
   - Standardized the capitalization of all headers on the `Shifts` page to title case. This change ensures consistent header formatting, enhancing readability for both drivers and admins.

2. **Enhanced Navbar Experience for Unauthenticated Users**  
   - Removed the navbar for unauthenticated users to ensure navbar information only appears for logged-in users, preventing potential 404 Not Found errors.

3. **Driver Information and UI Cleanup for `Driver Availability` Page**  
   - Updated the `Driver ID` in the `Driver Availabilities` table to be a clickable hyperlink, which directs users to the driver's information page.  
   - Removed the non-functional `Review` button to streamline the interface. 

   **Page can be accessed through `Admin > Driver Availabilities`.**

4. **Admin Can Assign Driver to a Shift Through a Drop-down List**  
   - Updated the ride requests form so that admins can select a driver and backup driver from a drop-down list displaying both the `driver ID` and corresponding full name.  
   - Previously, admins had to type in the driver ID number for both the driver and backup driver when creating a shift, which was very inconvenient.
   
   **Page can be accessed through `Shifts > Create New Shift`.**

5. **Admin Can Assign Driver to a Ride Request Through a Drop-down List**  
   - Updated the ride requests form so admins can select a `driver by ID`, full name, and next shift information for ease of use.
   - Previously admins typed in the `driver ID` meaning they had to remember or check which `driver ID` corresponded to each driver beforehand. Furthermore, they would lose their progress if they did not remember while filling out the form. This change solves this issue.

   **Page can be accessed through `Ride Request > Rides > Assign Driver`.**

6. **Fixed Driver Viewing Driver Availabilities Table Resulting in Backend Error**  
   - When a user with a `driver` role views the `Driver Availability` index page, they can see their listed availability with no errors occurring.

7. **Removed User Access to View all Driver Info**  
   - Only `admins` and `drivers` should be able to see any relevant info on all the drivers. Users being able to use these endpoints is a significant breach.

8. **Fixed Incorrect Labels on Pickup and Dropoff Time**  
   - Instead of Start Time and End Time, it now shows Pick Up Time and Drop Off Time in the error messages for `Submit New Ride Request`
   
   **Page can be accessed through `Ride Request > Request Ride`.**

9. **Removed tabs in navbar that Riders should not be able to access**  
   - Riders are now only able to see the `Ride Request` and related tabs in their navbar. They were previously able to see driver's information as well.

## Summary of Changes for Developer

1. **Developer can toggle swagger in NavBar**
   - A developer can easily turn on the swagger option on the app navbar for any deployment through defining an environment variable
   - When the config variable on dokku SHOW_SWAGGER_UI_LINK is set to true, the swagger link shows up.
   - When the config variable on dokku SHOW_SWAGGER_UI_LINK is set to false, the swagger link does NOT show up.

2. **Accepting a Rider Application Modifies the User's Role**
   - When an admin accepts a rider application through the review form, the user gains the Rider role. 
   - Previously admins had to accept at a rider’s application then traverse to the users page to update the user’s role manually.
     
   **Page can be accessed through `Admin > Rider Applications`.**
