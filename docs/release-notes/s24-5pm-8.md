# S24-5pm-8 Release Notes

## Summary of Changes for Users:

1. **Improved Readability of Shift Table Headers**  
   Standardized the capitalization of all headers on the `Shifts` page to title case. This change ensures consistent header formatting, enhancing readability for both drivers and admins.

2. **Enhanced Navbar Experience for Unauthenticated Users**  
   Removed the navbar for unauthenticated users to ensure navbar information only appears for logged-in users, preventing potential 404 Not Found errors.

3. **Driver Information and UI Cleanup for `Driver Availability` Page**  
   Updated the `Driver ID` in the `Driver Availabilities` table to be a clickable hyperlink, which directs users to the driver's information page.  
   Removed the non-functional `Review` button to streamline the interface. 

   **Page can be accessed through `Admin > Driver Availabilities`.**

4. **Admin Can Assign Driver to a Shift Through a Drop-down List**  
   Updated the ride requests form so that admins can select a driver and backup driver from a drop-down list displaying both the `driver ID` and corresponding full name.  
   Previously, admins had to type in the driver ID number for both the driver and backup driver when creating a shift, which was very inconvenient.
   
   **Page can be accessed through `Shifts > Create New Shift`.**

5. **Admin Can Assign Driver to a Ride Request Through a Drop-down List**  
   Updated the ride requests form so admins can select a `driver by ID`, full name, and next shift information for ease of use.
   Previously admins typed in the `driver ID` meaning they had to remember or check which `driver ID` corresponded to each driver beforehand. Furthermore, they would lose their progress if they did not remember while filling out the form. This change solves this issue.

   **Page can be accessed through `Ride Request > Rides > Assign Driver`.**
