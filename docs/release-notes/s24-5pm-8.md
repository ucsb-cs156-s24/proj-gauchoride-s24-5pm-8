3. **Driver Information and UI Cleanup for `Driver Availability` Page**  
   - Updated the `Driver ID` in the `Driver Availabilities` table to be a clickable hyperlink, which directs users to the driver's information page.

4. **Admin Can Assign Driver to a Shift Through a Drop-down List**  
   - Updated the ride requests form so that admins can select a driver and backup driver from a drop-down list displaying both the `driver ID` and corresponding full name.  
   - This update removes the need for admins to type in the `driver ID` number for both the driver and backup driver when creating a shift, which was very inconvenient.
   
   **Page can be accessed through `Shifts > Create New Shift`.**
   ![2 2](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s24/proj-gauchoride-s24-5pm-8/assets/42160992/f376b87a-ec6b-4f20-a3be-48703ed1bc19)


5. **Admin Can Assign Driver to a Ride Request Through a Drop-down List**  
   - Updated the ride requests form so admins can select a driver by `ID`, `full name`, and `next shift` information for ease of use.
   - Removed the nesasity for admins to type in `driver ID` so they no longer have to remember or check which `driver ID` corresponded to each driver beforehand. Furthermore, admins may lose their form progress if they did not the `driver ID` while filling out the form. This change solves this issue.

   **Page can be accessed through `Ride Request > Rides > Assign Driver`.**

7. **Removed User Access to View all Driver Info**  
   - Only `admins` and `drivers` should be able to see any relevant info on all the drivers. Users being able to use these endpoints is a significant breach.

   - Instead of Start Time and End Time, it now shows Pick Up Time and Drop Off Time in the error messages for `Submit New Ride Request`
   
   **Page can be accessed through `Ride Request > Request Ride`.**

9. **Removed tabs in navbar that Riders should not be able to access**

    - Updated the labels on the `Submit New Driver Availability` form so that each word is spaced out, making it easier for drivers to read and understand each field.

    - Provided example inputs for each form field to guide users on what should be inputed. 
    - Added error messages for bad and missing input for the `Start Time`, `End Time`, and `Day of the Week` fields, helping drivers submit correct information without encountering issues.
    - Made the `Note` field unrequired, user can input additional note when nesasary.  

    **Page can be accessed through `Shifts > Availability`.**

11. **Riders Can See Ride Request Assignment Status**
    - Added new column in the `Ride Request` page for `Riders` to indicate whether their ride request is being assigned to a driver. 
    - Fixed the issue where `Riders` could not view the acceptance status of their ride requests.

    **Page can be accessed through `Ride Request > Ride` when user only has the `Rider` role**

2. **Accepting a Rider Application Modifies the User's Role**
